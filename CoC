The guidelines presented may be updated to reflect the core values and expectations of supporting a diverse, equitable, and inclusive environment for all participants

Code of Conduct
By participating in the Fins and Limbs Lab, you must agree to our Code of Conduct and Operational Agreement. If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior, or have any other concerns, please report it by contacting the PI, Dr. Sandy Kawano (smkawano@gwu.edu), or submitting a report through an anonymous Google Form (http://bit.ly/CoC_report), which adapted language from the Code of Conduct Reporting form written by the Society for Integrative and Comparative Biology. For “Course”, you can type in “Fins and Limbs Lab”.     
Our Code of Conduct is adapted from: the Open Life Science Code of Conduct (https://openlifesci.org/code-of-conduct):
Be friendly, empathetic, and patient: “Walk a mile in someone else’s shoes”.
Be welcoming: Support people of all backgrounds and identities. This includes, but is not limited to, race, ethnicity, culture, nationality, color, immigration status, age, size, socioeconomic class, educational level, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, family status, political belief, religion, and mental and physical ability.
Be considerate: Some work takes years to finish and involves significant sacrifices. Constructive criticism is acceptable but avoid “bashing” someone’s work or comments. 
Be respectful: Disagreement is no excuse for poor behavior and poor manners. A community where people feel uncomfortable or threatened is not a productive one.
Be mindful of your actions: Do not insult, harass, or exclude other participants. Unacceptable behavior includes, but is not limited to: Violent threats or language, Discriminatory jokes and language, Posting sexually explicit or violent material, Posting (or threatening to post) other people’s personally identifying information, Insults, Racist or sexist terms, Unwelcome sexual attention, Encouraging any of the above behavior, etc. If someone asks you to stop, then stop.
Try to understand why we disagree: Resolve disagreements constructively. Diversity contributes to the strength of our community. Being unable to understand why someone holds a viewpoint doesn’t mean that they’re wrong. It is human to err and blaming each other doesn’t get us anywhere. Instead, focus on helping to resolve issues and learning from mistakes.




Operational Agreement
We can achieve and uphold our Code of Conduct by agreeing to the following Operational Agreement, which was adapted from: Sensoy, Özlem and DiAngelo, Robin (2014). Respect differences? Challenging the common guidelines in social justice education. Democracy and Education, 22(2), 1.

Strive for intellectual humility.
Hold your opinions lightly and with humility.
Let go of personal anecdotal evidence and look at broader group-level patterns.
Notice your own defensive reactions.
Recognize how your own social positionality (e.g., race, class, gender, sexuality, ability) informs your perspectives.
Differentiate between safety and comfort. Accept discomfort as necessary for growth.
Identify where your learning edge is and push it.
