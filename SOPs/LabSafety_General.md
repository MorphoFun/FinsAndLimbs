# Safety Procedures in the Kawano Lab #
**Location:** SEH 4100 and Bell 304
**PI:** Dr. Sandy Kawano

## Section A: New Authorized Personnel ##
1. “Authorized Personnel” are those who have key access to the labs.
2. IACUC will individually email new Authorized Personnel to complete the following:
  a. AALAS Learning Library courses
  b. Biosafety and Bloodborne Pathogens course
  c. Physical exam through the Employee Health Services
  d. Animal Risk Assessment Form
  e. GWUMC ARF Occupational Health Review
3. The PI will assign keys to each Authorized Personnel but extra keys are kept in lock boxes in each Department Office (ask staff or other lab members for the access code). 
4. All personnel will be required to complete the GW General Lab Safety training, which is offered at the beginning of the Fall semester through our Department seminar series. If you cannot make it to the seminar, you may request to attend a different training session through the following website: [https://safety.gwu.edu/laboratory-safety-training](https://safety.gwu.edu/laboratory-safety-training).
5. All personnel will be required to complete specific lab training sessions with the PI or other designated lab member, and then sign the lab safety training sheet (available in our Lab Safety Folders in each lab room).
6. The primary means of communication in the lab are email and Slack:
  a. Email addresses will be shared among lab members.
  b. To respect the privacy of personnel, personal phone numbers will NOT be shared by default. Personnel may choose to offer their phone number to others but may NOT ask others for theirs. 
  c. Personnel are encouraged to use our lab Slack group, which is particularly useful when it is unsafe to talk on the phone, such as in the event of an Active Shooter. 
  d. [Asana](https://www.asana.com/) is our primary tool to manage lab activities and monitor deadlines for different tasks. There is a Fins and Limbs page that everyone is connected to, but you are also encouraged to use it for your personal tasks. This is a useful tool to assign tasks to others, follow along the progress of different tasks, communicate with each other about specific tasks, etc. How to use Asana: [https://asana.com/guide](https://asana.com/guide).

2. Assorted protective eyewear and lab coats are available next to the fume hood in SEH 4100.
3. Disposable gloves are also available in each lab. 
4. Disposable gloves must be placed in a designated receptacle for biohazardous materials.
5. Once the bag is full, squeeze out the excess air, tape the bag shut, and then contact the PI to prepare for disposal. 

## Section H: Specific Hazards ##
1. **Dissections and other activities involving sharp objects** will need to abide by the [Sharps Safety policies](https://labsafety.gwu.edu/sharps-safety). 
  a. A sharps container is available on the lab counter. 
  b. Large, broken glass items should be placed in a sturdy cardboard box, taped shut, and labeled as “GLASS” for disposal in the regular trash receptacles.
  c. To remove scalpel blades: First, put on safety goggles. Second, use the designated Scalpel Remover Tool to safely remove scalpel blades from scalpel holders, and then dispose of the scalpel in a Sharps Container. Your hands should not directly touch the scalpel blade at any point of its usage. 
2. **The use of chemicals** must follow the General Safety Training information.
  a. *NO FOOD OR DRINKS ARE ALLOWED IN LAB.* All food or drinks must be hidden in personal bags, or placed outside of the lab. 
  b. ALL containers should be properly labeled (even water)! Please refer to this example for labeling containers: [http://web.csulb.edu/colleges/cnsm/safety/guides/labeling.html](http://web.csulb.edu/colleges/cnsm/safety/guides/labeling.html) 
  c. The chemical fume hood should be used to keep personnel safe from airborne chemical hazards.
  d. Disposal of hazardous chemical waste can be completed by filling out this form: https://safety.gwu.edu/hazardous-waste-pick. Do NOT pour hazardous material down the drain, and do NOT try to evaporate waste in the fume hood. If you are unsure about proper disposal of a particular chemical, ask the PI or other Authorized Personnel. Waste containers should be properly labeled, kept in the fume hood, and in service for no longer than 6 months. 
3. **Disposal of carcasses.** The carcasses / cadavers that we study in the lab are usually not considered biohazardous since they do not pose a threat to human health.
  a. Do not dispose of carcasses (or material dissected from the carcasses) into the regular trash bin.
  b. All carcasses ready for disposal should be placed in a plastic bag, properly labeled “FOR DISPOSAL”, and placed in one of the -20° Celsius freezers in SEH 4100. Afterwards, email the PI so that the material can be taken to the proper disposal facility. 
4. **Slip hazards** are possible due to the aquatic tanks in Bell 304 and aqueous solutions used in SEH 4100. If you are cleaning tanks or participating in any other activity that involves liquids, it is your responsibility to ensure that the lab area is dry and safe for others. 
  a. If water is spilled, use the provided cleaning supplies to wipe it up. 
  b. If a hazardous chemical is spilled, specialized procedures may be required. If unsure, please contact the PI for consultation. 
  c. Cleaning materials are available near the sinks in each lab.  
5. **Trip hazards** may be possible. Wires and cables should be carefully organized and bundled to decrease the possibility of tripping personnel. 
6. **Bites and scratches** from animals are unlikely for the species that tend to be studied in the lab, but are possible. In the event that personnel are bitten or scratched, please notify the PI immediately. These minor injuries can most often be remedied with the First Aid Kit (see Section 6: Injuries section), but notification and proper evaluation of the situation are required to determine whether specialized medical assistance is required.
